# Excel: Stock portfolio management

Project Requirements  Upon opening an account with your firm clients provide an initial payment of at least $100,000 which will be split between cash and the recommended 
portfolio of shares. 

Your spreadsheet should contain a list of shares held by the client, the number purchased and the original purchase price.    
As an environmentally focused investment firm – Wallstreet Investments splits investments in the portfolio into Green and non-Green stocks (e.g. petro chemical vs. windfarm) and 
ensures clients that at least 40% of their portfolio will be invested in Green stock at any one time. Stocks when chosen for addition to the portfolio are deemed “Green” or 
“non-Green” by the user.    

Multiple shares may be purchased in a given stock at different times and for different prices. The current valuation of all the shares owned in that particular 
company should be represented by the spreadsheet. Current valuations should be sourced from a suitable website (MSN, Bloomberg, NASDAQ etc.)    

It should be easy for users of the spreadsheet to indicate that a stock has been purchased and the purchase price. Similarly, it should be easy to sell all or part of a 
portfolio at the current market price. The spreadsheet should track transactions and the current portfolio and its valuation.     

The spreadsheet should present a dashboard summarising the portfolio of shares that the client has invested in. It should show the performance of the portfolio against standard
market indices (FTSE 100 and the NASDAQ for example) for the period in which the fund was invested. The dashboard should show the proportion of Green and non-Green assets in 
the portfolio.     It should be possible to view this summary in a browser window and e-mail the summary to the client.
